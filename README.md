# Reyz

Reyz was a major project where I learned proper scripting and level design. While the concept was big, the prototype itself was a decent example of what could have been done. The project was then later back burnered due to the fear of repeatitive gameplay, even with the features to be added later.

In Reyz, the player is cast into a maze and instructed to find their way out. At night, a demon will be released into the maze to chase the player and then retreat at dawn.

Reyz was the first project to have proper AI programming and behaviour and was also the first project where I learned to write save files, the same system still in use by Yoltrund today to some extent. It also uses the game locking system that is used by Donâ€™t Die! to prevent gameplay for updates or fixes since this game was originally designed to have an online leaderboard added later.

The assets and idea for Reyz was later converted into a minigame for Yoltrund.

The build for the game is available in the "build" folder. The source is available in the "source" folder. 

Reyz uses Unity 5.6.1f1, originally made in 5.5. With the libraries in the source, updating to 2017-2018 should not be a problem, but this is untested.
